        <li>Version (Titrated or Non-titrated)</li>
        <li>Number of items available; maximum number requested and starting number (if Titrated)</li>

      <h3>Knower level assignment</h3>
      <p>Knower level assignment for both the Titrated and Non-titrated versions of Give-N are based on <a href = https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-38732-001>Wynn (1992)</a>.</p>

      <h4>Subset knowers</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>If child correctly gives <i>N</i> at least 2 out of 3 times when requested (where <i>N</i> is not the maximum number tested), AND</li>
        <li>If child does not give that <i>N</i> incorrectly for another number more than 2/3 of the time when requested,</li>
        <li>Then child is identified as <i>N</i>-knower. </li>
        <li>In both Titrated and Non-titrated versions, the program assumes that knower levels are continuous. Knower level is the highest contiguous number known by the child. E.g., if a child succeeds on 1, 2, and 4, but fails on 3, the child is considered a 2-knower.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>CP knowers</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>If child correctly gives <i>N</i> at least 2 out of 3 times when requested (where <i>N</i> is the maximum number tested), AND</li>
        <li>If the maximum number is greater than 4,</li>
        <li>Then child is identified as CP knower. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Titrated Give-N Trial Logic</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Trial order is determined via a staircase function: for a given trial, if a child correctly gives <i>N</i>, the next number requested is <i>N</i>+1.</li>
        <li>If a child incorrectly gives <i>N</i>, the next number requested is <i>N</i>-1.</li> 
        <li>If the child demonstrates that they do not know a given N, the program will not test that N, or any number above that N.</li>
        <li>In general, the program avoids trying to test the same number two times in a row. This means, e.g., if child succeeds on the maximum number (e.g., 6), the program will test 5, rather than testing 6 again.</li> 
      </ol>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Non-titrated Give-N Trial Logic</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Each number (specified by user in test setup) is tested three times, with a randomized order within each set (e.g., if the numbers to be tested are 1-5, program shuffles those numbers for first test, then shuffles again for second and third tests).</li>
        <li>Each number is tested three times, regardless of performance.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

      <h3>Logic of determining known and unknown numbers</h3>
      <p>Both the Titrated and Non-titrated versions use the same logic for determining known and unknown numbers, drawn from Wynn (1992)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For given <i>N</i>, if child correctly gives <i>N</i> at least 2/3 times when asked for <i>N</i>, <i>and</i>, when giving that <i>N</i> does not give it more than 2/3 of time in response to another number, the child knows <i>N</i>.</li>
        <li>For given <i>N</i>, if child fails to correctly give <i>N</i> at least 2/3 times when asked for <i>N</i>, the child does not know <i>N</i>.</li>
        <li>The program assumes that, if child falsely gives <i>N</i> for another number at least twice, the child does not know <i>N</i> (even if <i>N</i> has not been tested).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

      <h3>A note on knower level assignment in the Titrated version</h3>
      <p>At the end of each trial, the program evaluates the evidence to determine whether a child can be assigned a knower level. If a knower level is assigned, the task ends. There are several conditions under which a knower level can be assigned: 
      <ol>
        <li>If the current <i>N</i> is known and is the highest testable number (N-knower).</li>
        <li>If the current <i>N</i> is not known and is 1 (0-knower).</li>
        <li>If the current <i>N</i> is known, and the number above it is not known (N-knower).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are several other conditions under which the program may or may not determine a knower level; these situations largely stem from a child failing two numbers at the same time (e.g., incorrectly giving 2 in response to 4). </p>
